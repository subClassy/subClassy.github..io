![My profile](../assets/images/profile.jpg)

Hi!! My name is Himank Goel and I am a recent graduate with a degree in Computer
Science specializing in Visual Computing. Throughout my studies and 
internships, I have honed my skills in all things Computer Vision.

I am particularly passionate about 3D computer vision and its potential to 
enable new forms of human-computer interaction, navigation in augmented and 
virtual reality and revolutionize a wide range of other industries. During my 
time at SFU, I had the opportunity to work on projects such as pixelNERS, where 
I developed an algorithm for 3D object reconstruction from partial views.

I am excited to continue my career in computer vision and am always open to new
opportunities to learn and grow. Thank you for visiting my website and I look 
forward to connecting with you!
