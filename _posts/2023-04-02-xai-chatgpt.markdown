#### The WHY?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can perform tasks 
that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural 
language, recognizing images, playing games, and generating content. However, 
many AI systems are based on complex algorithms that are difficult to understand 
and explain, especially for non-experts. These systems are often referred to as 
"black boxes", because their inner workings are hidden from view.

This lack of transparency and interpretability can pose challenges for users, 
developers, regulators, and society at large. For example, how can we trust an 
AI system that makes decisions that affect our lives, such as diagnosing 
diseases, approving loans, or driving cars? How can we ensure that an AI system 
is fair, ethical, and accountable? How can we debug and improve an AI system 
that makes errors or behaves unexpectedly?

#### The WHAT?

These questions motivate the need for **Explainable AI (XAI)**, a set of 
processes and methods that allows human users to comprehend and trust the 
results and output created by machine learning algorithms. Explainable AI is 
used to describe an AI model, its expected impact and potential biases. It 
helps characterize model accuracy, fairness, transparency and outcomes in 
AI-powered decision making.

Explainable AI is crucial for building trust and confidence in AI systems, 
especially in domains where human lives or values are at stake. It can also help
developers improve and optimize their models, regulators ensure compliance with
standards and regulations, and users understand and control their interactions 
with AI systems.

#### The WHEN?

The concept of XAI is not new. In fact, it has been around for decades. It was
first introduced in 2004 by Van Lent et al.[1], in the context of the non-player
characters [NPCs] in video games. The authors proposed a framework to extract 
key events and decision points from the playback log to allow the NPC AI 
controlled soldiers to explain their behavior in response to the questions 
selected from the XAI menu. Of course, this paper was not the first one to 
motivate this concept, but it was the first one to introduce the term "XAI" 
as per my knowledge.

#### The HOW?

Explainable AI can be achieved in different ways, depending on the type and 
complexity of the AI system, the level and purpose of the explanation, and the 
target audience. 
Some common approaches include:

- Using interpretable models that are inherently transparent and easy to 
understand, such as decision trees, linear models, or rule-based systems. These
are often called as *Model-Specific approaches*. These are tailored to a specific
type of model and uses the characteristics of the model to provide explanations.
    
    - *Decision Trees*: Decision trees are a type of model that can be easily 
    visualized and interpreted. They provide explanations by showing the 
    decision path from the root node to the leaf node.

    - *Rule-based Systems*: Rule-based systems use a set of rules to make 
    decisions. These rules can be easily interpreted and provide explanations 
    by showing which rules were used to make a decision.

    - *Linear Models*: Linear models are simple and interpretable, making them 
    suitable for providing explanations. They provide explanations by showing 
    the weights assigned to each feature in the input.

    - *Symbolic Models*: Symbolic models use logical expressions to make 
    decisions. They provide explanations by showing the logical rules used to 
    make a decision.

- Applying post-hoc techniques that analyze and explain the behavior of 
black-box models.These approaches provide explanations after the model has been 
trained and do not require any modification to the model architecture.

    - *Gradient-based methods*: Gradient-based methods use the gradient of the 
    model output with respect to the input to identify the important features. 
    They provide explanations by highlighting the important features in the input.

    - *Perturbation-based methods*: Perturbation-based methods involve 
    modifying the input data and observing the changes in the output. They 
    provide explanations by identifying which features in the input have the 
    most impact on the output.

    - *Prototype-based methods*: Prototype-based methods involve identifying 
    the most representative instances in the data and using them to explain the 
    model output. They provide explanations by showing which instances in the 
    data are most similar to the input.

- Providing interactive tools that allow users to explore and visualize the 
input-output relationships of AI systems. These are called Model-Agnostic 
Approaches since they do not require any specific knowledge about the underlying
machine learning model and can be applied to any model. LIME and SHAP are 
examples of model-agnostic methods that provide local explanations of model 
predictions.

    - *LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)*: LIME provides 
    local explanations for individual predictions. It works by approximating the
    underlying model with a simpler, interpretable model in the local region 
    around the prediction.

    - *SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)*: SHAP provides global and local 
    explanations for model predictions. It uses the concept of Shapley values 
    from cooperative game theory to assign a contribution score to each feature 
    in the input.

- Incorporating human feedback and collaboration into the design and evaluation 
of AI systems, such as through user testing, co-creation, or explainable agents.

    - *User Testing*: User testing involves asking users to perform tasks with 
    an AI system and observing how they interact with it. This can be used to 
    identify potential issues with the system and to improve the user 
    experience.

    - *Co-creation*: Co-creation involves involving users in the design and 
    development of AI systems. This can be used to ensure that the system 
    addresses the needs of the users and to improve the user experience.

    - *Explainable Agents*: Explainable agents are AI systems that can explain 
    their decisions to users. This can be used to improve the user experience 
    and to build trust in the system.

#### The WHY NOW?

One domain where Explainable AI is particularly relevant is natural language 
processing (NLP), which is the branch of AI that deals with understanding and 
generating natural language. NLP has seen remarkable advances in recent 
years, thanks to the development of deep learning models such as ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is being used for countless applications, such as chatbots, text 
summarization, text generation, or text completion and so much more - [ossinsight](https://ossinsight.io/collections/chat-gpt-apps/)
has a great list of ChatGPT applications and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

However, ChatGPT is also a black-box model that is hard to interpret and explain. 
It is not clear how ChatGPT generates its text outputs, what factors influence 
its choices, what biases or errors it might have, or how it can be improved or 
controlled. Moreover, ChatGPT can potentially generate harmful or misleading 
content that can affect users' emotions, opinions, or actions.

In fact, these concerns are shared by leading tech luminaries such as Elon Musk,
Steve Wozniak and others where they have signed an open letter title ["Pause 
Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter"](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/).
The letter calls for a moratorium on the development of AI systems that have 
"human-competitive intelligence" and "pose profound risks to society and humanity".
On a side note, this has been a very interesting topic of discussion and I recommend 
reading about it. Some of the good articles I found are:

- <https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/a-misleading-open-letter-about-sci>
- <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/>
- <https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2023/03/stop-openai-from-launching-gpt-5.html>
- <https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7174>

In the light of all this, tools like Explainable AI can play an important role. 
By providing explanations for how ChatGPT works and why it produces certain 
outputs, Explainable AI can help users understand and trust ChatGPT's 
capabilities and limitations. It can also help developers monitor and improve 
ChatGPT's performance and quality. Furthermore, explainable AI can help 
regulators ensure that ChatGPT complies with ethical principles and social 
norms.

P.S. I am not an expert on XAI. This is just what I have been reading in the past
few weeks. I am sure there are many more things to be said about XAI and its 
relevance in the modern AI research. I would love to hear your thoughts on this
in the comments below.
