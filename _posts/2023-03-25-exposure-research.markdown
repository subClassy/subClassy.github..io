Auto exposure algorithms are an essential feature of digital cameras, helping to
ensure that images are captured with the appropriate exposure levels in a wide 
range of lighting conditions. I discussed this in great details in my last 
[blog](https://subclassy.github.io/auto-exposure). While these algorithms have 
traditionally been designed with consumer photography in mind, the recent 
academic research has taken a different approach. Instead of focusing on 
consumer goods, the latest research papers are geared towards acquiring the 
best possible images for computer vision tasks and algorithms including 
autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and virtual reality. To develop more 
accurate and efficient auto exposure algorithms, researchers aim to improve the 
quality of images by using more sophisticated techniques, which is what I will 
be covering in this blog. In this blog, I will delve into a series of five
chronological research papers in auto exposure and examine the innovative 
approaches that are advancing the field of photography and computer vision.

#### Introduction

In the realm of auto exposure research, what I have realized is that the entire
idea of these research papers can be broken down into *four* key areas. 

<ol>
<li><strong>Prediction Model</strong> - The prediction model to determine the
optimal exposure setting for a scene can be based on either deep learning (DL) 
or non-DL approaches. Non-DL based models often use heuristical approaches to 
make predictions. On the other hand, DL-based models use neural networks to 
learn from large datasets of images to predict the optimal combination of gain 
and shutter speed. Some researchers are also developing hybrid approaches that 
combine both DL and non-DL based models to achieve the best of both worlds.</li>

<li><strong>Optimization Metrics</strong> - In addition to prediction models, 
researchers also focus on defining optimization metrics that determine what 
makes a good image or sequence of images. Common optimization metrics used in 
auto exposure research include dynamic range, gradient information, entropy, 
etc. These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of an image captured under
variety of exposure settings.</li>

<li><strong>Algorithm Focus</strong> - The purpose of the algorithms differes 
from paper to paper. Some researchers focus solely on shutter speed, while 
others work on optimizing both shutter speed and gain. As discussed in my last 
<a href="https://subclassy.github.io/auto-exposure">blog</a> shutter speed 
refers to the amount of time that the lens is open and hence it determines the 
amount of light that enters the camera, while gain refers to the amplification 
of the signal to achieve a desired brightness level. There is a third line of 
choice as well where the algorithms are designed to work on an implicit 
definition of "exposure value", rather than breaking it down to explicit 
settings.</li>

<li><strong>Dataset</strong> - Finally, the choice of dataset approach plays a 
critical role in auto exposure research. There are not a lot of public datasets
which conform to the requirements of a specific academic paper. The auther tend
to use specialized datasets that are tailored to specific applications. For 
example, researchers working on autonomous driving might use a dataset of 
images collected from cameras mounted on cars, while those working on facial 
recognition might use a dataset of faces captured under different lighting 
conditions. Hence, this is where data acquisition itself becomes a major 
component of these papers.</li>
</ol>

By considering these four main ideas - prediction model, optimization metric, 
algorithm focus, and dataset approach - researchers are able to develop more 
robust and effective auto exposure algorithms that can be applied across a wide 
range of computer vision applications.
